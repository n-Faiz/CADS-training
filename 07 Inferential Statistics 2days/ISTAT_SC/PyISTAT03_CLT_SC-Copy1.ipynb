In other words, the mean of the sample means will be $\\mu$, just as the mean of sample proportions was $p$.\n",

In others words, we might expect greater variability in sample means for smaller samples. So sample size will again play a role in the spread of the distribution of sample measures, as we observed for sample proportions.\n",

    "* **Shape**: Sample means closest to 3,500 will be the most common, with sample means far from 3,500 in either direction progressively less likely. In other words, the shape of the distribution of sample means should bulge in the middle and taper at the ends with a shape that is somewhat normal. This, again, is what we saw when we looked at the sample proportions.\n",

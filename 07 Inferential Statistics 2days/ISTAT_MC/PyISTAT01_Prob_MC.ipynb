    "Say we have a random sample that is representative of the population. However, each random sample is not exactly the same. One random sample may represent the population very accurately, while another random sample might not be representative. Therefore, by looking at any one sample, we will never know how much a sample resembles the population. We can use probability to describe the variation in random samples. Probability is a critical tool for **statistical inference** — drawing reliable conclusions about the population considering the uncertainty that is generated by taking a random sample of a population. The following example will illustrate this important point."

To do so, we choose a random sample of 1,200 Malaysian adults to take a digital problem-solving assessment. We find that 970 out of the 1,200, or 81%, are digitally literate.\n",

    "If we examine another random sample, it may give us a very different result. So we cannot be sure about how well the sample describes the population. However, this uncertainty is due to randomness, not due to problems with how the sample was collected. Therefore, we can use probability to describe the likelihood that our sample is within a desired level of accuracy. For instance, using probability we can answer the question, \"How likely is it that our sample estimate is no more than 3% from the true percentage of all digitally literate Malaysian adults?”\n",

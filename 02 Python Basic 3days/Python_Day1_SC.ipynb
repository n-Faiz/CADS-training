    "**High-level.** Python is a very high-level programming language. High-level programming languages have strong abstraction from the details of the computer. For example memory management has been taken care of. So in the code you will see commands that sound natural like english and the details under the hood of those commands are already being taken care of. Handy!\n",

    "**Object Oriented.** Python is an Object Oriented Programming Language. It means that functionality is bundled together in objects and you can reason with those objects and let them interact.\n",

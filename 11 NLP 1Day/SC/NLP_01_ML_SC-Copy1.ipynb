       "'BLU Life XL - LTE Smartphone - GSM Unlocked - 16GB +2GB RAM - Dark BlueI purchased this phone to replace a worn out Samsung Galaxy S2 that I dropped, causing EOL (End of Life) of that hand set. I had to call upon my old HTC LEO that had been NAND Flashed with ICS 4.4.2. My wife calls it my Franken-phone. I was certian I had become a \"Samsung\" guy, having never been short-changed by a Samsung device of any type. Seriously, how many can say they were still using a S2 until last month. However, it pains me to even think about spending $500+ on a new phone. Therefore, I set out on my quest to find a good as new S5, or something reasonable. I stumbled across this handset while searching for my \\'new\\' handset. After reading the glowing review by Armin Tamzarian (http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A2XCCN239AR1XK/ref=cm_cr_dp_pdp) on BLU Phones, my mission inadvertantly became a quest to see which BLU handset would please me. I don\\'t get sidetracked, really I don\\'t. I am a buyer, not a shopper. In about 5 minutes I had selected the BLU Life XL- LTE as it had everything important to me. A good processor, lots of RAM, ample storage, high power camera, LTE, great price... oh yeah, and it would work... I figured at that price I could give it to my grandkids to play with if I didn\\'t like it. For that price, I could by 3 or 4 or so before I reach a new top of the line handset. When it arrived it was packaged nicely. I took the phone out of its box and checked it over. It was very slim and every part fit well. I\\'m not sure about the owners manual, it was kinda sketchy, but who really needs one these days. Our society has made leaps and bounds from the flashing VCR light of the 80\\'s. Pretty much any 3 yr old can work a new phone, no matter how complicated it is. If you need help, I might be able to have my grandson walk you through. He was on Youtube in a matter of seconds when he had his go at it, watching Steven Segal movie clips. I removed the back. It was much easier than a Samsung has ever been, but not so easy as to come off all the time. I plugged my Micro SIM and my 32 gig SD card in, put the battery in and powered it on. The battery had an 80% charge and took me through a few start up screens. It asked me which backup I wanted to restore from, the S2 or the HTC NEXUS (my Franken-phone). I chose the S2, it took off. I logged into my GMAIL account and almost everything was restored from the S2 into this new, sleeker, unheard of device. Being the skeptic, I have to say I was impressed at the ease of the setup. However, I was not going to be that easy to sway over to the BLU, but it had already intrigued me thus far. I noticed that the Live \"Black Hole\" back ground was the same one I had on the HTC and think is just awesome. My Carrier had originally offered the Live backgrounds on the Samsung devices, but took them away because they ate battery life and caused numerous complaints on the subject. SO, I wanted to see how this one fared running it 24 x 7. I charged up the battery to 100% before I started any real testing. So far, BLU has won me over. I have measured it against a Note 3, an S3, Galaxy 10 tablet on WIFI, an iPHONE 5, and my old standby the rooted HTC LEO. It is faster than them all, and has not locked up one single time. The radio in it is very strong and even out does the HTC LEO on reception (in the past the HTC LEO had always surpassed many handsets in reception with the OEM Windows CE, or in rooted Android. It has been touted as the phone that won\\'t die). All my calls have been crystal clear, even in areas I had had trouble with in the past. I continued my testing. I tried to cause problems by leaving Chrome, Opera, Gas Buddy, Yahoo email, Gmail, IMDB, YouTube, Messaging, Google Maps, and Navigation apps up and running and felt no adverse effects. I let it run 20 hrs, all the time i made a few calls, surfed the web, took some pictueres, set it up as a WIFI hub, did a few searches with my laptop, and it still had 20% battery life. We took a trip last weekend to see one of our Daughters and her family. on the way I handed it over to my wife to check out. I now get the \"honey, let me see your phone\" quite often since. She thoroughly tested the camera, facebook app, and internet on the road reading an eBook. No complaints. The camera passed with flying colors. I guess I know what to get her for her upcoming birthday. It always seems that the \\'name brand\\' handsets slow down at 6 months or so. You know, when the new handset offerings hit the market. I will update this posting around that time if it slows. If not, then you will know I am still happy... At this point, the BLU Life XL has become my favorite phone of all time. I have retired my rooted HTC Leo back to its rightful position in my drawer. Lets pause for Stay tuned to see if it needs to be called upon again...'"

Generally, <b>the contiguous sequences of items in NLP</b> — words, letters, or symbols— is also called an n-gram. The choice of the number n in the n-gram model depends on the particular application. For instance, spam filtering applications tend to use n=3 or n=4 for good performances.\n",

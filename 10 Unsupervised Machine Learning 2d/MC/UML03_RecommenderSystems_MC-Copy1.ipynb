    "The primary goal of a recommender system is to **predict how a user would rate an item** they haven't interacted with yet, e.g. predicting movie ratings or recommending products.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the context of a business, where recommender systems find the widest application, this goal can be broken down into several subgoals:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Relevance**\n",
    "    - Identify items that the user will find most useful or interesting. For example, if a customer buys toothpaste then they are probably also interested in a toothbrush. \n",
    "- **Diversity**\n",
    "    - Recommended items should not be essentially identical. To continue with the example, recommending 10 identical toothbrushes in different colors would most likely annoy a potential customer. \n",
    "- **Novelty**\n",
    "    - Recommender systems should be able to identify novel or rare items. Popular items rarely need to be advertised or recommended and a user will be able to explicitly search for these items. The recommender system should suggest items the user would not have thought of or found by themselves.\n",
    "- **Serendipity**\n",
    "    - Closely related to novelty, recommended items should be able to surprise a potential customer. For example, instead of just dental care products, a recommender system could suggest items that benefit oral hygiene indirectly, such as calcium- and fluoride-rich foods."

    "### Types of Interactions\n",
    "Interactions form the basis of recommender systems. We differentiate between two kinds of interactions.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Explicit interactions**\n",
    "    - Deliberate actions taken by users, e.g. rating a movie.\n",
    "    - Usually sparse, e.g. users won't rate hotels they don't stay at\n",
    "    - Potentially biased towards positive ratings, e.g. users won't watch a movie that has already received overwhelmingly negative reviews.\n",
    "- **Implicit interactions**\n",
    "    - By-products of user interaction with a service, e.g. page views of websites or click rates of advertisements\n",
    "    - Are usually collected automatically, e.g. through web server logs.\n",
    "    - Much more dense, e.g. a user looking for a hotel for a holiday will browse many different listings. These listings can be analyzed to determine what a user's interests are, e.g. similarities between listings or time spent on each listing page. There may be dozens of listings a user looks at, for which multiple features can be captured. The user will ultimately only leave a single, explicit rating for the hotel he stayed at, however. Furthermore, unless a written review was left as well, this explicit rating will contain only a single, numerical feature.\n",
    "    - Better representation of user *needs*. For example, a user may rate a 3-hour documentary with 5/5 stars, indicating they love it. Because they are busy, however, they prefer watching TV episodes, even though they may not rate these as highly. Implicit interactions would correctly indicate the preference for short TV shows versus long movies for daily viewing whereas explicit interactions couldn't capture this."

   "source": [
    "#### Collaborative Filtering\n",
    "\n",
    "Collaborative filtering uses only interaction data between users and items, such as ratings, to make recommendations. The foundation of these approaches is an interaction matrix of the following form:\n",
    "\n",
    "<table>\n",
    "    <tr style=\"border-bottom: 2px solid black;\"><th></th><th>User 1</th><th>User 2</th><th>User 3</th><th>User 4</th></tr>\n",
    "    <tr><th>Item 1</th><td>1</td><td></td><td></td><td>2</td></tr>\n",
    "    <tr><th>Item 2</th><td>5</td><td>2</td><td></td><td></td></tr>\n",
    "    <tr><th>Item 3</th><td></td><td>1</td><td>2</td><td></td></tr>\n",
    "</table>\n",
    "\n",
    "- This matrix is used to generate a ranked list of recommendations or to infer missing scores. Either items or users are grouped by their similarity with regards to the ratings and recommendations made accordingly.\n",
    "- The accuracy of recommendations improves both with the total number of user-item interactions as well as the number of users in the dataset themselves.\n",
    "\n",
    "Collaborative filters are by far the most popular recommender systems. There are two reasons for this:\n",
    "- **Simple to implement**: No information on the items or users is needed, making these algorithms easy to implement and also transfer to different problems.\n",
    "- **No feature engineering**: The lack of feature engineering or parameter tweaking means that these systems will usually work 'out of the box' and deliver 'good-enough' results.\n",
    "  \n",
    "Disadvantages of collaborative filtering include:\n",
    "- **Data sparsity**: Especially for explicit ratings, the interaction matrix will be very sparse. For example, a hotel recommendation system may have tens of thousands of hotels in their database. Individual users, however, will only have visited and rated a handful of these. This makes it difficult to compute similarities between hotels.\n",
    "- **Long training times**: Collaborative filters utilize the entire user-item interaction matrix to make recommendations. This means that any time a new user is added, the item-item distances must be re-calculated. This can lead to a monumental computational overhead for large datasets.\n",
    "- **Poor performance for small data**: If a dataset has only very few users then a collaborative approach won't exhibit nearly the same power as other approaches.\n",
    "- **Requires item standardization**: Very similar items in a dataset are still regarded as separate items and must be manually combined beforehand, e.g. if multiple vendors sell the same product through eBay then ratings for the product should be combined and only recommended once."

    "#### Content-Based Filtering\n",
    "As opposed to collaborative filtering, which uses the entire ensemble of user-item interactions to make recommendations, content-based filtering focuses on individual users and makes explicit use of item features to create a user-specific content profile. The matrix from above can be extended to include the features of individual items, e.g.\n",
    "\n",
    "<table>\n",
    "    <tr style=\"border-bottom: 2px solid black;\"><th></th><th>User 1</th><th>User 2</th><th>User 3</th><th style=\"border-right: 1px solid black;\">User 4</th><th>Item Feature 1</th><th>Item Feature 2</th><th>Item Feature 3</th></tr>\n",
    "    <tr><th>Item 1</th><td>1</td><td></td><td></td><td style=\"border-right: 1px solid black;\">2</td><td>0.4</td><td>0.8</td><td>0.04</td></tr>\n",
    "    <tr><th>Item 2</th><td>5</td><td>2</td><td></td><td style=\"border-right: 1px solid black;\"></td><td>0.9</td><td>0.1</td><td>0.3</td></tr>\n",
    "    <tr><th>Item 3</th><td></td><td>1</td><td>2</td><td style=\"border-right: 1px solid black;\"></td><td>0.85</td><td>0</td><td>0.1</td></tr>\n",
    "</table>\n",
    "\n",
    "Predicting user ratings for items essentially becomes a supervised learning problem based on existing ratings.\n",
    "\n",
    "Advantages of this approach are:\n",
    "- **Short training times**: Recommendations are made on the basis of ratings given by a single user, which makes updating the recommender system very fast.\n",
    "- **New items can be immediately recommended**: Whereas collaborative filters would simply ignore items that have never been rated, the inclusion of intrinsic features means that new items in our dataset can be immediately recommended.\n",
    "\n",
    "It appears content-based filters solve the problems of collaborative filters. However, they also come with their own disadvantages:\n",
    "- **Cold-start problem**: Because content-based filters do not make use of the entire set of users, new users must first rate many items before personalized recommendations can be made.\n",
    "- **Feature enginnering**: The nature of the items to be recommended must be quantified in the form of features. Feature engineering for complex data, such as movies, is difficult and can heavily impact the performance of a recommender system.\n",
    "- **Overspecialization**: The system will never recommend items outside of a user's content profile, which is generated based on historical choices. If a user has never rated a horror movie, for example, the system will never recommend one unless specifically instructed to do so. This is closely related to the cold-start problem."

    "#### Other Recommender Systems\n",
    "Recommender systems are often highly specialized and customized to the available data and purpose of the system. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Social recommender systems** make use of user demographic data and social connections, e.g. Facebook friendships, to recommend items to users. Aggregating users by their demographics and using connections as metrics of similarity can help alleviate the *cold-start* problem, i.e. making recommendations to a new user without any historical data. This approach still suffers from the \"popularity problem\" in that popular items will be favored over new and unknown ones.\n",
    "- **Knowledge-based recommender systems** use explicit user input to make recommendations. For example, a user searching for a property to buy can indicate conditions such as the location, desired number of rooms, the maximum price. This allows personalized recommendations without historical data and is especially useful for situations where historical data is inherently rare, e.g. most people won't buy very many houses in their lives. The downside of this approach is that it requires specific domain knowledge, meaning that the system must know what a user will like without having historical data to validate this, e.g. a user interested in a four-bedroom house most likely has children and will be interested in child-friendly neighborhoods.\n",
    "- **Hybrid recommender systems** combine collaborative and content-based approaches. This not only improves the recommendation performance but also compensates for the weaknesses of individual recommender systems. Recommenders can be combined as a weighted ensemble, in which recommendations from all systems are collated into a single list, or in a switching manner, where specific recommenders are chosen on a case-by-case basis."

    "- Implicit scores: Implicit scores, although much richer and more informative, must also be carefully preprocessed\n",

    "- There are other, more powerful Python libraries for constructing recommender systems. For example, Apache Spark is a powerful library (Python implementation `pyspark`) that allows for the construction of recommender systems (See an example [here](https://perso.telecom-paristech.fr/qleroy/aml/lab2.html))"

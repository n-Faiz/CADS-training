    "``k-Nearest Neighbours (KNN)`` falls in the **supervised learning** family of algorithms and it is a famous classification algorithm because it is easy to understand and its good performance however, it is computationally expensive. The KNN algorithm classifies an unlabelled test sample based on the majority of similar samples among the k number of its nearest neighbors. \n",

    "- 1. **Training phase:** The training samples and the class labels of these samples are stored. no missing data \n",
    "       allowed. No non-numeric features allowed in case of using Euclidian distance. In case of categorical \n",

    "       a) Distances from the test sample to all stored training sample are calculated using a specific distance function or similarity measure. <br><br>\n",

    "### Pros and Cons of KNN\n",
    "\n",
    "**Pros**\n",
    "\n",
    "As you can already tell from the previous section, one of the most attractive features of the K-nearest neighbor algorithm is that is **simple to understand** and **easy to implement**. Furthermore, KNN works just as easily with **multiclass datasets** whereas other algorithms are hardcoded for the binary setting. Finally, as we mentioned earlier, the **non-parametric nature** of KNN gives it an edge in certain settings where the data may be highly “unusual”.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Cons**\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the obvious drawbacks of the KNN algorithm is the **computationally expensive** testing phase which is impractical in industry settings. Furthermore, KNN can **suffer from skewed class distributions**. For example, if a certain class is very frequent in the training set, it will tend to dominate the majority voting of the new example (large number = more common). Finally, the accuracy of KNN can be severely degraded with **high-dimension data** because there is little difference between the nearest and farthest neighbor.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Improvements\n",
    "\n",
    "With that being said, there are many ways in which the KNN algorithm can be improved.\n",
    "\n",
    "- A simple and effective way to remedy skewed class distributions is by implementing **weighted voting**. The class of each of the K neighbors is multiplied by a weight proportional to the inverse of the distance from that point to the given test point. This ensures that nearer neighbors contribute more to the final vote than the more distant ones. To use weighted voting, in `KNeighborsClassifier()` set `weights = 'distance'`.\n",
    "\n",
    " <img src='../images/WeightedKnn.png'/>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Changing the distance metric** for different applications may help improve the accuracy of the algorithm. (i.e. Hamming distance for text classification)\n",
    "- **Rescaling your data** makes the distance metric more meaningful. For instance, given 2 features $height$ and $weight$, an observation such as $x=[180,7]$ will clearly skew the distance metric in favor of height. One way of fixing this is by column-wise subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation. Scikit-learn’s normalize() method can come in handy.\n",
    "- **Dimensionality reduction** techniques like PCA should be executed prior to appplying KNN and help make the distance metric more meaningful.\n",
    "- **Approximate Nearest Neighbor** techniques such as using k-d trees to store the training observations can be leveraged to decrease testing time. Note however that these methods tend to perform poorly in high dimensions (20+)."

    "# 2. Decision Trees: Classification \n",
    "\n",
    "Decision trees are widely used models for classification and regressions. Essentially, they learn a hierarchy of if/else questions, leading to an action.  \n",
    "\n",
    "These questions are similar to the questions you might ask in a **game of 20 Questions**. Imagine you want to distinguish between the following four animals: \n",
    "\n",
    "**bears, hawks, penguins, and dolphins**.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src='../images/DecisionTree.png'>\n",
    "\n",
    "Your goal is to get to the right answer by asking as few if/else questions as possible. You might start off by asking whether the animal has feathers, a question that narrows down your possible animals to just two. If the answer is \"yes\", you can ask another question that could help you distinguish between hawks and penguins. For example, you could ask whether the animal can fly. If the animal doesn’t have feathers, your possible animal choices are dolphins and bears, and you will need to ask a question to distinguish between these two animals—for example, asking whether the animal has finns. This series of questions can be expressed as a decision tree.\n",
    "\n",
    "Machine learning speaking, we want to build a model to distinguish between these four classes of animals using three features (has feathers, can fly, has fins). But instead of building these models by hand, we can learn them from data using supervised learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Building decision trees\n",
    "\n",
    "Usually, data does not come in the form of binary yes/no features, but is instead represented by continuous features. So, we expect the \"questions\" to be in \"threshold\"-like form, such as \"Is feature *i* larger than value *a*?\" To build a tree, the algorithm has to search over all possible conditions and finds the one that is most informative about the target variable. Using the two moons toy dataset, let's see how it's done.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](../images/decisiontrees-step1.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "First, splitting the dataset vertically at x[1]=0.0596 yields the most information; it best separates the points in class 1 from the points in class 2. The top node, also called the root, represents the whole dataset, consisting of 75 points belonging to class 0 and 75 points belonging to class 1. The split is done by testing whether x[1] <= 0.0596, indicated by a black line. If the test is true, a point is assigned to the left node, which contains 2 points belonging to class 0 and 32 points belonging to class 1. Otherwise the point is assigned to the right node, which contains 48 points belonging to class 0 and 18 points belonging to class 1. Even though the first split did a good job of separating the two classes, the bottom region still contains points belonging to class 0, and the top region still contains points belonging to class 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](../images/decisiontrees-step2.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we repeat the process of looking for the best (or the most informative) way to split further in both regions. This is depth 2 of the decision tree. This recursive process yields a binary tree of decisions, with each node containing a\n",
    "test condition. We can view this algorithm as building a hierarchical partition. The recursive partitioning of the data is repeated until each region in the partition (each leaf in the decision tree) only contains a single target value (a single class or a single regression value). A leaf of the tree that contains data points that all share the same target value is called *pure*. The final partitioning for this dataset is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "![](../images/decisiontrees-finalstep.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Predicting the target class or value of new data point:**\n",
    "\n",
    "A prediction on a new data point is made by checking which region of the partition of the feature space the point lies in, and then predicting the target class with the majority (or the single target in the case of *pure* leaves) in that region. The region can be found by traversing the tree from the root and going left or right depending on whether the test condition is fulfilled or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is also possible to use decision trees for regression tasks, using exactly the same technique. To make a prediction, we traverse the tree based on the tests in each node and find the leaf the new data point falls into. The output for this data point is the mean target value of the training points in this leaf."

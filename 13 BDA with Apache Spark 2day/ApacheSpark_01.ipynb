Now, let's see how we can take a sample, or a subset of that, but randomly. In PySpark, `sample()` method returns a sampled subset of this DataFrame, and it usually takes two parameters, `fraction` that specifies the fraction of rows to generate, range [0.0, 1.0]. The second parameter is `withReplacement`, which is a boolean parameter. Usually, we assign `false` to it, in this case, what that means is each time we pull a row out of our sampling, we don't put it back in, so we will never get duplicates, we will always get unique values.
